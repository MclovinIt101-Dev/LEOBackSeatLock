# LEOBackSeatLock

The Missing Door Handles resource is a FiveM script that addresses the issue of missing door handles in the backseats of certain vehicles. It provides a solution to prevent players from exiting the vehicle when the backseat door handles are missing/Locked.

## Installation

1. Download the `LEOBackSeatLock` resource.
2. Place the `LEOBackSeatLock` folder in your FiveM server's `resources` directory.
3. Add `start LEOBackSeatLock` to your server.cfg file.

## Usage

Once the resource is installed and started, it will automatically detect if a player is in a vehicle with missing backseat door handles. If the player attempts to exit the vehicle from the backseat, a notification will be displayed indicating the issue.

## Configuration

The resource currently does not have any configuration options. However, there are plans to add the following features in future updates:

- Add a configuration file to allow customization of vehicles with missing door handles.
- Implement a configuration option to disable the default emergency vehicle class and rely on a custom vehicle array.

Stay tuned for future updates to the resource for these additional configuration options.
